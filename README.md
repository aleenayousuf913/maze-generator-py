I want to share with you guys one of my more recent, more complex projects: a maze generator in python. To implement this code, python 3.6+ and matplotlib are required 

The maze creation and solving is terminal (prints maze as ASCII grid) but the maze visualiztion is done using a graphical window (matplotlib plot)

Feautures
- Maze generation using DFS (recursive backtracking)
- Maze solving using BFS
- visualizes the maze and path using matplotlib
